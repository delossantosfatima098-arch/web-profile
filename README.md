Files
- `index.html` â€” the portfolio HTML markup
- `style.css` â€” the stylesheet with responsive layout and variables
- `assets/` â€” suggested place for `profile-placeholder.png` and `favicon.svg`

How to use
1. Replace placeholder text like `[Your Name]`, `[Your University]`, and links with your real details.
2. Add a profile image to `assets/profile-placeholder.png` (recommended 800x800, square).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.

Customization
- Edit `style.css` to change colors (CSS variables at the top). The primary color is `--accent`.
- Add or replace project entries in the `#projects` section of `index.html`.

Deploy
- The site is static â€” you can deploy it to GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in the repository settings and setting the source to the `main` branch (or `gh-pages`).
- Alternatively, drag the folder into any static host (Netlify, Vercel, or an Apache folder like XAMPPâ€™s `htdocs`).
